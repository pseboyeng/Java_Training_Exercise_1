This is the First practice exercise on Java Class Structure and methods.
I made a simple command line program. It is a Banking Application that lets the banker registers a new client.
Once the registration is complete, the new client is able to make transactions on the app.

#TODO: There is a sickening bug that rears its ugly head during runtime. For example, When I deposit R300, the balance changes to a lower amount. Your Job is to find a logical bug, and fix it so that the deposited amount gets updated with the balance, otherwise the BozzaBank will loose clients in droves. So come on developers, do a diligent search for this error and fix it.
